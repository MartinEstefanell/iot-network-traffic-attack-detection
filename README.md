# IoT Network Traffic Attack Detection

Academic project focused on detecting malicious network traffic using the RT-IoT2022 dataset.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze network traffic data containing both benign and malicious activity in order to identify patterns associated with network attacks and contribute to the development of an attack detection algorithm.

## Dataset
RT-IoT2022, a dataset containing labeled IoT network traffic with benign and malicious flows.

## What we worked on
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature analysis and interpretation
- Contribution to a network attack detection approach
- Analysis of traffic behavior at a system level

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Data analysis libraries
- Network traffic analysis
